# Packaging A plumber api for cloud run.

I am using the default plumber.R created by Rstudio when you select File \> New File \> Plumber API...

It creates 3 endpoints:

1.  GET /echo
2.  GET /plot
3.  POST /sum

The plan is to use Cloud Build to listen to a github repository. When the repository is updated, cloud build pulls the changes, creates a new docker container, and redeploys API to cloud run.

## check the API into github
This test will be checked into the danielruss/R_cloud_run repository.

## create the cloud build trigger.
